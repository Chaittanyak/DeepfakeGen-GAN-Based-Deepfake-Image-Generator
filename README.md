# Deepfake Image Generation using GANs in Python

In this project, we have developed a deepfake image generation model using Python, specifically employing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). GANs are a class of deep learning models well-suited for generating high-quality data, making them ideal for tasks like image generation and deepfake creation.

## Key Approaches and Algorithms

### DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)
Our model is based on the Deep Convolutional GAN architecture. DCGANs combine generative and discriminative elements within a deep neural network, allowing for high-quality image generation.

### Image Augmentation
We applied various image augmentation techniques, including rotation, scaling, and flipping, to enhance the diversity and realism of the generated images.

### Conditional GAN (cGAN)
We utilized a conditional GAN approach, which involves adding a conditioning label to the input data. This allows our GAN to generate images with specific attributes, making it particularly useful for deepfake generation.

## Dataset

We leveraged the CelebA dataset, a well-known dataset commonly used for face generation and deepfake creation. The CelebA dataset comprises approximately 200,000 images of celebrity faces, each accompanied by annotations such as identity, gender, and age.

## Jupyter Notebook Contents

In our Git repository, you'll find a Jupyter notebook that outlines the steps involved in creating the deepfake image generation model. The notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Importing Libraries**: We begin by importing essential libraries and modules, such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and OpenCV, to support our project.

2. **Generator Model**: We define the generator model, implementing a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architecture. The generator takes a random latent vector as input and generates a realistic image.

3. **Discriminator Model**: The discriminator model is defined using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architecture. It takes an image as input and calculates a probability value, indicating the likelihood of the image being real or generated.

4. **Training Process**: We outline the training process, which involves generating random latent vectors and using them to create new images. These generated images are then evaluated by the discriminator, which learns to differentiate between real and generated images.

5. **Image Generation**: This section covers the image generation process, which starts by generating a random latent vector. This vector is then used to create a new image, which is subsequently resized and normalized to match the dimensions and color scale of the training images.

6. **Model Training**: Finally, we train the model using the CelebA dataset, allowing it to learn and generate deepfake images with the specified attributes.

The Jupyter notebook in the Git repository contains the code and detailed explanations to help you recreate this deepfake image generation model in Python.
